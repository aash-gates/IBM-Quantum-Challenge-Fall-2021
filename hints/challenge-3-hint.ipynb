    "### How to convert three label probabilities into 3-class prediction\n",
    "In Challenge 3c, you need to create a final 3-class classification prediction from three label probabilities. Here is a hint for that part. The following is an example of what you should implement for 5 samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input**: three label probalibities\n",
    "- label 0: [0.1, 0.5, 0.2, 0.9, 0.4]\n",
    "- label 2: [0.3, 0.1, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6]\n",
    "- label 3: [0.6, 0.2, 0.4, 0.1, 0.3]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**: 3-class classification prediction\n",
    "- prediction: [3, 0, 3, 0, 2]\n",
    "\n",
    "The conversion rule is to use the label with the highest label probability as the prediction for each data. For example, looking at the first data, the probalities of label 0, 2, 3 are 0.1, 0.3, 0.6 respectively, where the probability of label 3 is the highest, therefore the prediction is chosen to be label 3.\n",
