**Challenge-2a:**
* The **_total number of AOs is equal to the number of MOs_** according to the Linear Combination of Atomic Orbital (LCAO) principle.
* To count the total number of atomic orbitals, you need to _**count the number of atoms**_ for each element and then _multiply the number of AOs per element_ provided by the notebook:
```python
num_ao = {
    'C': 14,
    'H': 2,
    'N': 14,
