# Preliminary Content (Week 0)

In preparation for the first week of the challenge, you should make yourself familiar with the foundational content necessary to understand and complete the four challenges and associated exercises. If you already have a background in some of these topics, or have already set up your IBMid account, then you may skip those parts of Week 0. The first challenge, and subsequent challenges, from week 1 will assume that you have completed these preliminary exercises.
