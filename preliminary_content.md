# Preliminary Content (Week 0)

In preparation for the first week of the challenge, you should make yourself familiar with the foundational content necessary to understand and complete the four challenges and associated exercises. If you already have a background in some of these topics, or have already set up your IBMid account, then you may skip those parts of Week 0. The first challenge, and subsequent challenges, from week 1 will assume that you have completed these preliminary exercises.

## Linear Algebra

Most quantum computing algorithms require an understanding of linear algebra to formulate the problem. However, you need not be an expert on the topic to complete the IBM Quantum Challenge Fall 2021. Here are  the resource that can help you learn or brush-up on the foundations of linear algebra and matrices.

## Python Crash Course

Qiskit, and thus the challenge, is implemented in Python. If you’re not familiar with Python, you can learn how the basics from the Qiskit Textbook chapter on [Python and Jupyter Notebooks](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-prerequisites/python-and-jupyter-notebooks.html). Jupyter notebooks are an interactive way to program and are the most common method for communicating Qiskit work. All exercises for the challenge are provided as Jupyter Notebooks on the IBM Quantum platform. To access the platform, you should create an account using the links provided in the section below.
