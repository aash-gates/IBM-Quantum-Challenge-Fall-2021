# Frequently Asked Questions
## General
#### How do I submit an answer?

Within each exercise notebook, on the [challenge portal](http://ibm.co/challenge-fall-21), you will find guidelines to submit an answer. For example in the challenge 1 notebook, for exercise 1a:

```python
# Submit your answer using following code
from qc_grader import grade_ex1a
grade_ex1a(qiskit_module_names)
```

#### Can I run the challenge notebooks on a local computer?

Yes it is possible. But we strongly recommend you solve the exercises on the [challenge portal](http://ibm.co/challenge-fall-21). If you really want to run the exercises locally, you can download the notebooks from the [challenge repository](http://ibm.co/challenge-fall-21-repo) and run using Jupyter notebook.

#### Can we check answers on a local computer?

Yes it is possible. But similar to the above question, we strongly recommend you solve the exercises and check answers on the [challenge portal](http://ibm.co/challenge-fall-21). If you really want to check answers on a local computer, you need to install the [grading client](https://github.com/qiskit-community/Quantum-Challenge-Grader) in addition to downloading the notebooks.

#### Do we need to download the notebooks from github?

No, you can run all exercises on the [challenge portal](http://ibm.co/challenge-fall-21) itself.

#### Do I need to take the exercises in order?
