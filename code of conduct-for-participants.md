# Code of Conduct for Participation

The IBM Quantum Challenge Fall 2021 and the Qiskit Community team are committed to maintaining the highest level of enjoyment, accessibility, and inclusivity by maintaining an environment of respect, empathy, and compassion for others. In order to support that, we ask that each participant review the Qiskit Community Code of Conduct before the event, and be familiar with our community standards to join us in maintaining a safe and welcoming event for all.

We have zero tolerance for any type of harassment, and welcome each and every attendee as you support these values and make this hackathon and the Qiskit Community a friendly and open space for everyone.
