# Code of Conduct for Participation

The IBM Quantum Challenge Fall 2021 and the Qiskit Community team are committed to maintaining the highest level of enjoyment, accessibility, and inclusivity by maintaining an environment of respect, empathy, and compassion for others. In order to support that, we ask that each participant review the Qiskit Community Code of Conduct before the event, and be familiar with our community standards to join us in maintaining a safe and welcoming event for all.
