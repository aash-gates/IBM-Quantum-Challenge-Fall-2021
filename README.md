## Introduction

 We are proud to welcome you back for another IBM Quantum Challenge. Our team has developed an exciting series of exercises designed to showcase some of quantum computing's different industry applications using Qiskit's application modules: Finance, Nature, Machine Learning, and Optimization.

Starting October 27 at 09:00 AM (EDT), join us on a 10-day challenge that will grow your quantum computing knowledge and skills as you use Qiskit to tackle real-life problems with quantum algorithms.
